# WFRP Google Map
A tool to easily visualize the Warhammer world.

# Requirements
This tool requires a few url params to operate:
- `key` => This is your google maps API key, get one here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key
- `tileURL` => the domain of the host of the image tiles. I'll eventually upload my own to this project
# Running
- clone
- `reload -b` in directory

# Thanks
Based heavily on the work from gitzmansgallery.com, a big inspiration for this project.
