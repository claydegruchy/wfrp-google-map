# WFRP Google Map
A tool to easily visualize the Warhammer world.

# Requirements
This tool requires a few url params to operate:
- `key=<key>` => This is your google maps API key, get one here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key
- `story=true` => this activates 'story mode' for my own personal game and shows off the features of read only mode
- `???=???` => this secret key enables edit mode

This all go on as params to look something like this:

# Running

- `npm start` in directory

# Thanks
Based heavily on the work from gitzmansgallery.com, a big inspiration for this project.
